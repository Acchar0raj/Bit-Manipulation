ðŸ”§ Bit Manipulation in C++ and Verilog

This repository contains bit manipulation implementations in both C++ and Verilog.
It is designed as a reference for competitive programming, embedded systems, and RTL design.

ðŸ“‚ Structure

cpp/ â†’ C++ bit manipulation programs

verilog/ â†’ Verilog HDL bit manipulation modules

Each folder has its own README.md with detailed explanations and usage instructions.

âš¡ Bitwise Operators Overview

Bit manipulation works directly at the binary level. Below are the most common operators:

Operator	Symbol	Description	Example (a = 5 = 0101, b = 3 = 0011)	Result
AND	&	1 if both bits are 1, else 0	a & b = 0101 & 0011	0001 (1)
OR	|	1 if any bit is 1	a | b = 0101 | 0011	0111 (7)
XOR	^	1 if bits are different	a ^ b = 0101 ^ 0011	0110 (6)
NOT	~	Inverts bits (1 â†’ 0, 0 â†’ 1)	~a = ~(0101)	(depends on width)
Left Shift	<<	Shifts bits left (fills with 0)	a << 1 = 0101 << 1	1010 (10)
Right Shift	>>	Shifts bits right (drops LSB)	a >> 1 = 0101 >> 1	0010 (2)
ðŸ›  Common Bit Tricks

Check if i-th bit is set

if (num & (1 << i)) { /* bit is set */ }


Set i-th bit

num |= (1 << i);


Clear i-th bit

num &= ~(1 << i);


Toggle i-th bit

num ^= (1 << i);


Count set bits (Population count)

__builtin_popcount(num); // GCC/Clang


Check if number is power of 2

if (num > 0 && (num & (num - 1)) == 0) { /* true */ }
